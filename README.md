# s3lector - AWS S3 Web Downloader

Built on the MEAN stack: [mean.io](http://mean.io).


s3lector is a web front end to allow authenticated downloads from Amazon S3 buckets.


Configured buckets are listed and file info is stored in a Mongo DB. 
File info is presented to logged in users as a filterable list. 
When a file is selected for download, a temporary signed url is generated for the S3 object to allow the user to access the object.
A bucket can be marked as private - only users with private access level can view these files.
Any configured bucket is set as public by default - authenticated users can view access all files.


## Prerequisites
* A server with nodejs, mongodb and npm installed
* an AWS user and credentials with access to your S3 bucket

## Additional Packages
* Express - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* Mongoose - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* Passport - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* Bower - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* AngularJS - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.
* Twitter Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.
* UI Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.

## Quick Install
  The quickest way to get started is to use openshift.

  Use the following command, make sure that you run 'gem update rhc' first so that you have the newest version:

	  rhc app create s3lector nodejs-0.10 mongodb-2.2 --env NODE_ENV=production --from-code https://github.com/pr8kerl/s3lector.git

  Then clone the resulting application repo, update config/env/production.js with passport credentials.

  Log in to your application using ssh and access the Mongo shell and manually select your database (use s3lector).
  Then copy and paste the contents of config/mkAdmin.js into mongo shell. Need to work out a better way to do this.

  Push your changes to openshift and then access the url for your app. Log in as the default admin created previously to test access.

  Follow your nose. You'll work it out.


## Slow Install
  Setup your own environment using Node and MongoDB.

  Install dependencies:

    $ npm install

  Create config file
  ```cp config/env/production.js config/env/development.js```
  Configure passport and AWS access in **config/env/development.js**

  Create an admin user in the database using the mongo script

    cd util
    mongo <db name> ./mkAdmin.js

  Start the server:

    $ grunt
    
  Then open a browser and go to:

    http://localhost:3000

  Authenticate as a new user

  Logout and log back in as the admin user.

  Set your new user as an admin.

  Log out and in as previous user and remove the default admin.

  Configure a bucket 

  Load bucket contents into database (this lists files in the bucket once and stores that info in the mongo db).


## To Do

Remaining intended features
* allow S3 object upload for admins
* allow api access to load S3 file info into database
